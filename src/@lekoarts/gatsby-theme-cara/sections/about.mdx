#### I fell in love with ReactJS as I created my first project and I did not have to reload everytime I wanted to see changes and the reuseable components you could use in any project you like and the huge community ReactJS has is just impressive.
I am a Computer Science Graduate. During my four years bachelors program I learnt about modern programming technologies and i was interested in two of them. One was machine learning and the other was web development. I chose web development as I loved when I saw the results to my code and I think I can have a bigger impact on the world through web development than any other major in Computer Science.
